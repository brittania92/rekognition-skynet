# Pet Rekognition- Operation Skynet
Using Amazon Rekognition and Machine Learning to detect dog and cat images.

In this project, I was able to train and configure my Machine Learning Model (datasets) to recognize cat as well as dog images. This process called for configuring the ECR and creating the App Docker Image; Creating the ECS cluster and Task & Service

Upon successfully configuring the model and service, the endpoint was able to recognize each image with over 99.999% accuracy.
